# Knights Province Launcher

This launcher was made for Knights Province.  
It will play the role of euto-updating the game and providing a few links to the project's websites.

Requirements:
  * RAD Studio XE2+ (I think)
  * Cindy components for Delphi
  * madCollection (madExcept)

How to contribute:
  * Fork this repository
  * Create a new branch with a name specific to the update
  * Commit and push your updates to the new branch
  * Create a PR (Pull Request)

TODO:
  * Create an image to replace the placeholder. ( Dynamic content pulled from the website, perhaps? )
  * Improve the way updates are presented/downloaded.
  * Improve the way updates are applied.
  * UI improvements. ( I'm aware that my UIs are far from ideal )
  * Overall cleanup.
