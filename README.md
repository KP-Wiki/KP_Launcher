This launcher was made for Knights Province.
It will play the role of euto-updating the game and providing a few links to the project's websites.

Requirements:
  * RAD Studio XE2+ (I think)
  * Cindy components for Delphi

How to contribute:

  3> Commit and push your updates to the new branch
  4> Create a PR (Pull Request)

TODO:
  1> Create an image to replace the placeholder. ( Dynamic content pulled from the website, perhaps? )
  2> Improve the way updates are presented/downloaded.
  3> Improve the way updates are applied.
  4> UI improvements. ( I'm aware that my UIs are far from ideal )
  5> Overall cleanup.
